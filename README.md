# Flying-shark

This project is a "remake" of the arcade game Flying Shark (1987) for the TI-99/4A home computer (1981). It is written in TMS9900 assembly language.

The game is assembled as a 512K cartridge image for FinalGROM99/UberGROM/red boards and requires a 32K RAM expansion. It will not run from FlashROM99 or disk.

The game can be played using joystick 1 or keyboard (S, D, E, X, Space). If you start the game using the keyboard only the keyboard will be active and vice versa. Hold down fire/space a little longer to fire a smart bomb. Key M on the title screen turns off the music.

The graphics are based on the ZX Spectrum version of the game, and the music was  recreated after listening to the arcade version. None of the original program code has been used for the remake.

Thanks to Tursi for the use of his music/sound player and to ralphb for his xas99 assembler.
